	    <h2>Here Are My Top 5 Go To Resources</h2>
	  </div>
	  <div class="content-container emailonacid">
	    <h3>1. Email On Acid</h3>
	    <a target="_blank" href="https://emailonacid.com"><img src="/images/emailacid-min.png" alt="email on acid"></a>
	    <p>
		 When you want to test emails on a budget my go to is Email On Acid.
		 Now I might be biased about Email on Acid because I am a subscriber
		 but their testing site is pretty good. There are many benefits when it comes to 
		 using this service, one of which is a predeployment checklist. This allows Error
		 free emails to be made easier and quicker. Also this list includes cool tips
		 to improve accessibility of your email in order to keep it user friendly as
		 possible. Another benefit is getting the most bang for your buck,
		 it has one of the best monthly subscription price in comparison to other ESPs, especially if you're a
		 freelancing. Plus it comes with multiple user logins.

	    <h3>2. Litmus</h3>
	    <a target="_blank" href="http://litmus.com"><img src="/images/litmus-min.png" alt="litmus website"></a>
	    <p>
		 Litmus is a great ESP (Email Service Provider) that most businesses
		 use, with a great 24 hour support service as well. It also allows
		 you to preview emails for a wide variety of email clients. Another
		 benefit is that it offers the service called "PutsMail" which allows
		 you to send emails for free.
	    </p>
	  </div>
	  <div class="content-container emailonacid">
	    <h3>3. Campaign Monitor</h3>
	    <a target="_blank" href="http://CampaignMonitor.com"><img src="/images/campaign-min.png" alt="CampaignMonitor.com"></a>
	    <p>
		 A great feature that
		 <a href="http://CampaignMonitor.com">CampaignMonitor.com</a> has is
		 tons of other email blogs and other useful resources to go to for
		 superb tips. Lastly, it offers "The Ultimate Css Guide" which is very
		 useful for seeing which CSS properties are not allowed for
		 email clients.

	  <div class="content-container emailonacid">
	    <h3>4. Inspirational Emails</h3>
	    <a target="_blank" href="http://Reallygoodemails.com"><img src="/images/inspo-min.png" alt="Reallygoodemails.com"></a>
	    <p>
		 Need practice for creating unique emails? Then
		 <a target="_blank" href="http://reallygoodemails.com">Reallygoodemails.com</a>
		 is the website for you! This site offers amazing emails to look at
		 with attractive colors and fonts. This includes a cool code preview of each email
		 to see how it was done by a pro. Looking at other developers code

	  <div class="content-container emailonacid">
	    <h3>5. Outlook Conditional CSS</h3>
	    <a target="_blank" href="https://stackoverflow.design/email/base/mso/"><img src="/images/outlook-min.png" alt="Outlook conditional css"></a>
	    <p>
		 One thing that many Youtubers / Courses don't talk about is Outlook
		 Conditional CSS. Windows outlook clients can lead to many rendering
		 issues and Outlook Conditional CSS is way to solve these issues.
		 Theres a good documentation about this on
		 <a href="https://stackoverflow.design/email/base/mso/">Stackoverflow.com</a>
		 which shows a guide on basic syntax to place in your code. Another
		 upside to using conditional css is "Ghost Tables", which allows you
		 to use css properties that Outlook doesn't support such as
		 (inline-block, max-width, min-width).
