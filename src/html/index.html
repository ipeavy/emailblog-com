		 When you want to test emails on a budget my go to is Email On Acid.
		 Now I might be biased about Email on Acid because I am a subscriber
		 but their testing site is pretty good. There are many benefits when it comes to 
		 using this service, one of which is a predeployment checklist. This allows Error
		 free emails to be made easier and quicker. Also this list includes cool tips
		 to improve accessibility of your email in order to keep it user friendly as
		 possible. Another benefit is getting the most bang for your buck,
		 it has one of the best monthly subscription price in comparison to other ESPs, especially if you're a
		 freelancing. Plus it comes with multiple user logins.

		 Litmus is a great ESP (Email Service Provider) that most businesses
		 use, with a great 24 hour support service as well. It also allows

	    /></a>
	    <p>
		 One thing that many Youtubers / Courses don't talk about is Outlook
		 Conditional CSS. Windows outlook clients can lead to many rendering
		 issues and Outlook Conditional CSS is way to solve these issues.
		 Theres a good documentation about this on
		 <a href="https://stackoverflow.design/email/base/mso/"
		   >Stackoverflow.com</a
		 >
		 which shows a guide on basic syntax to place in your code. Another
		 upside to using conditional css is "Ghost Tables", which allows you
		 to use css properties that Outlook doesn't support such as
		 (inline-block, max-width, min-width).
